  - Of course! Let me see your map. Ah, I see. You are here outside a house. To you
    local lies the Enchanted Forest, filled with magical plants and hidden secrets.
  - To the South, you'll find the Mystic Cave, home to an ancient gatekeeper and
    lurking dangers.
  - And up above, in the skies, is the majestic Cloud City, where the wise sages
    keep the dragon.
